THINGS TODO (in order)
	- Select top 2 models from Guass and Tilt
		- Large and small embedding dimension
		- Move these models into generic folder
		- args: /results/tuned/small_tilt/ (call this in inner.py) 
	- Change code for tuning
		- allow for tuning only critiquing
		- select model from ^
	- Exps: improve upon graphs using sim_select with direct updating

TODO: Armin
	- update code for tuning only
	- run on all 4 models as default for crit only inner loop
	- preserve all old functionality

TODO: Griffin
	- check code for n=1
	- replicate results for single direct
	- update sim_selector for random sample from top k similar embeddings
	- check that plots are saved


Monday Experiments
================================================
direct single - gaussian
	- sim_selector movie k = [1, 5] - random
	- correct test - random, diff, pop

indirect - gaussian
	- local computer
